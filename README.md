    Our team developed a web application inspired by AirBnb using Laravel and Inertia. The application allows users to search for and book accommodations, as well as manage their own listings if they are hosts. The search functionality is powered by TomTom search, and payments are processed using Braintree.
    One of the unique features of our application is the ability for users to filter their search results by neighborhood, allowing them to find the perfect location for their stay. Additionally, we implemented a messaging system to facilitate communication between hosts and guests.
    The project was completed as part of our experience at Boolean Careers, where we gained hands-on experience with modern web development tools and best practices. We are proud of the final result and confident in our ability to apply the skills we have learned to future projects.
    We believe that our project showcases our abilities as developers and our passion for creating innovative solutions using the latest technologies.
    Thanks Team1, Thanks Class#75.
